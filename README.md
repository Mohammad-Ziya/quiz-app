# Quiz App 🧠🎯

A simple JavaScript Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This is my first real JavaScript project, created as a beginner with minimal help from AI and Google. The main purpose of this project was to understand core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, events, and basic application logic.

## How the App Works

- Quiz questions are stored as an array of objects in JavaScript.
- Each question and its options are rendered dynamically on the page.
- When a user selects an option:
  - The answer is checked against the correct one.
  - Correct and wrong options are highlighted.
- Score and progress update automatically.
- After the final question, the quiz ends and a restart button appears.

## What I Learned

- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event handling using `addEventListener`
- Working with arrays and objects
- Updating the UI dynamically
- Managing application state (score and current question)
- Basic debugging and logical problem-solving

---

## Limitations

- No timer functionality
- No randomization of questions
- No score persistence (localStorage not used)
- Basic UI focused more on logic than design

---

## Future Improvements

- Add a timer
- Shuffle questions
- Store high scores using localStorage
- Improve UI and animations

## Note

This project intentionally reflects my beginner skill level. It focuses on learning and understanding JavaScript fundamentals rather than being a polished or advanced application.
